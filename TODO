- Exception handling : What happens if one or more part fails to upload. How to handle such a case

- Cancelling/Interrupts : What if user cancels the operation mid-way ? Close the lid of his/her system ?

- Using queues : Check if using queues will be useful

- asyncio.sleep() : Use it with 0 delay to see if the code performs better

- Progress bar : Show how much is uploaded and how much more time is left. Will also be useful to show the difference between sync and async code
